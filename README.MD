# Bumpers &mdash; Pokemon
This project was created in a week as a homework exercise / competition (about 10hrs of actual programming). The goal of the exercise was to modify a very limited car game to be as creative as possible. A strict CI pipeline needed to pass, so the code base contains a lot of inconsistency between cars and pokemon.

Be warned: the limitations mentioned above (especially the tight time constraint) resulted in a rather <em>hacky</em> code that is not meant to be used. 

The class responsible for processing the battles is [PokemonCollision.java](https://github.com/plainerman/bumpers-pokemon/blob/master/src/de/tum/in/ase/eist/collision/PokemonCollision.java) (in which you are probably most interested).
